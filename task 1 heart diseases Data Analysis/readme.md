# Week 1 â€“ Heart Disease EDA

## Project Goal
target condition of having or not having heart disease and then the model is investigated using ML explainability tools and techniques.

## Dataset
[Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots
- Feature engineering (age bins, cholesterol levels)
- Optional: Logistic Regression for prediction

## Results / Insights
- Age and sex are significant risk factors
- Patients with high cholesterol and BP have higher survival risk
- Simple ML model accuracy: 78%

## How to Run
1. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Install required libraries:
